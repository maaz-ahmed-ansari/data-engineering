# Running Postgres and pgAdmin with Docker-Compose

- Why do we need Docker-compose
- Docker-compose YAML file
- Running multiple containers with docker-compose up


- Now from this folder in which docker-compose.yaml is present, open terminal and run

```docker-compose up```

or

```docker-compose up -d```

To stop:

```docker-compose down```
